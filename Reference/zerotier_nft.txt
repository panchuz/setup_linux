nftables cheat sheet:

Load rules: nft -f /etc/sysconfig/nftables.conf (this will append them to the existing ones, so flushing first might be required)
Watch rules: nft list ruleset
Reset rules: nft flush ruleset
Speaking of your request:

nft list ruleset | grep dport

Since tables and chains can be called pretty much anything, it's kinda hard to devise a script which will list only rules for type filter hook input.
